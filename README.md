# morancj/ama

A repository to ask [@moranj](https://github.com/morancj/) anything.

Lifted from [holman/ama](https://github.com/holman/ama): what a brilliant idea!

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/morancj/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll answer questions
[when I get around to it, if I get around to it](http://bofh.bjash.com/newbofh/bofh6nov.html).
Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered - if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/moranj/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Forking

If you'd like to create your own AMA repository:

- Click `Fork` at the top of [holman/ama]
